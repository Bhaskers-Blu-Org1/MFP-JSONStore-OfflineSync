  &lt;property name="createDatabaseIfItDoesNotExist" displayName="Create database if it does not exist?" defaultValue="false" /&gt;
  ...
&lt;/mfp:adapter&gt;
</code></pre>

### 5.4 Specify Cloud Object Storage credentials in MFP Adapter

Open `MobileFoundationAdapters/MyWardData/src/main/adapter-resources/adapter.xml` and update the following properties to point to the Cloud Object Storage created in [Step 3](https://github.com/IBM/Ionic-MFP-App#step-3-create-ibm-cloud-object-storage-service-and-populate-it-with-sample-data).
  * Specify value for `bucketName` as created in [Step 3.1](https://github.com/IBM/Ionic-MFP-App#31-create-ibm-cloud-object-storage). 
  * Specify `serviceId` and `apiKey` created in [Step 3.2](https://github.com/IBM/Ionic-MFP-App#32-create-service-id-and-api-key-for-accessing-objects).
  * While creating the bucket in [Step 3.1](https://github.com/IBM/Ionic-MFP-App#31-create-ibm-cloud-object-storage), if you selected a different Location/Resiliency, then update the `endpointURL` as per the specification in https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/basics/endpoints.html#select-regions-and-endpoints.

<pre><code>
&lt;mfp:adapter name="MyWardData" ...&gt;
  ...
  <b>&lt;property name="endpointURL" displayName="Cloud Object Storage Endpoint Public URL" defaultValue="https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net"/&gt;

  &lt;property name="apiKey" displayName="Cloud Object Storage API Key" defaultValue=""/&gt;</b>
&lt;/mfp:adapter&gt;
</code></pre>

## Step 6. Deploy the MFP Adapters and Test them

### 6.1 Build and Deploy the MFP adapters

Build and deploy `UserLogin` Adapter as below.

```
$ cd MobileFoundationAdapters/

$ cd UserLogin
$ mfpdev adapter build
$ mfpdev adapter deploy
```

  Note: In [Step 4](https://github.com/IBM/Ionic-MFP-App#step-4-create-mobile-foundation-service-and-configure-mfp-cli), if you specified `No` to `Make this server the default?`, then you need to specify the name of your server profile (`Cloud-MFP` in our case) at the end of `mfpdev adapter deploy` command as shown below.
```
$ mfpdev adapter deploy Cloud-MFP
```

Build and deploy `MyWardData` adapter as below.

```
$ cd ../MyWardData/
$ mfpdev adapter build
$ mfpdev adapter deploy
```

Build and deploy `JSONStoreCloudantSync` adapter as below.

```
$ cd ../JSONStoreCloudantSync/
$ mfpdev adapter build
$ mfpdev adapter deploy
```

### 6.2 Launch MFP dashboard and verify adapter configurations

Launch MFP Dashboard as below:
  * In the [IBM Cloud dashboard](https://console.bluemix.net/dashboard/), under `Cloud Foundry Services`, click on the `Mobile Foundation` service you created in [Step 4](https://github.com/IBM/Ionic-MFP-App#step-4-create-mobile-foundation-service-and-configure-mfp-cli). The service overview page that gets shown, will have the MFP dashboard embedded within it. You can also open the MFP dashboard in a separate browser tab by appending `/mfpconsole` to the *url* mentioned in [Step 4](https://github.com/IBM/Ionic-MFP-App#step-4-create-mobile-foundation-service-and-configure-mfp-cli).
  * Inside the MFP dashboard, in the list on the left, you will see the `JSONStoreCloudantSync`, `UserLogin` and `MyWardData` adapters listed.

Verify MFP Adapter configuration as below:
  * Inside the MFP dashboard, click on the `JSONStoreCloudantSync` adapter. Under `Configurations` tab, you should see the various properties we specified in [Step 5.3](#53-specify-cloudant-credentials-in-mfp-adapter) for accessing Cloudant database as shown below. As an alternative to specifying those property values in `MobileFoundationAdapters/JSONStoreCloudantSync/src/main/adapter-resources/adapter.xml` as previously shown in [Step 5.3](#53-specify-cloudant-credentials-in-mfp-adapter), you can deploy the adapters with empty `defaultValue`, and once the adapter is deployed, change the values on this page.

  <img src="doc/source/images/AdapterConfiguration.png" alt="Option to specify the credentials for accessing Cloudant NoSQL DB in deployed MFP Adapter" width="800" border="10" />

  * Click on `Resources` tab. You should see the various REST APIs exposed by `JSONStoreCloudantSync` adapter as shown below. The `Security` column should show the protecting scope `UserLogin` against each REST method.
    
  <img src="doc/source/images/AdapterProtectingScope.png" alt="The REST APIs of JSONStoreCloudantSync adapter are protected by UserLogin security scope" width="800" border="10" />

### 6.3 Test the JSONStoreCloudantSync adapter

Create temporary credentials to test adapter REST API as below:
  * Inside the MFP dashboard, click on `Runtime Settings`. Click on `Confidential Clients`. Then click on `New`.
  * In the form that pops up, specify values for `ID` and `Secret` as shown in snapshot below. For `Allowed Scope` enter `**` and click on `Add`. Finally click on `Save`.

  <img src="doc/source/images/MFP_CreateCredentialsToTestAdapter.png" alt="MFP - Create Confidential Client to test Adapter REST APIs" width="1024" border="10" />

Test adapter REST API as below:
  * Inside the MFP dashboard, click on the `JSONStoreCloudantSync` adapter. Click on `Resources` and then click on `View Swagger Docs`. The Swagger UI for adapter REST APIs will get shown in a new window/tab.
  * Inside the Swagger UI, click on `Expand Operations`.
  * To test the `POST /getAllModifications` API, first click on `OFF` toggle button to enable authentication. Select `UserLogin` and click on `Authorize` as shown below. Enter the `ID` and `Secret` created above against `Username` and `Password`. Click `OK`. If authentication is successful, the toggle button will switch to `ON` position.

  <img src="doc/source/images/AuthorizeSwaggerUI.png" alt="Authorize Swagger UI for running MFP Adapter REST APIs" width="1024" border="10" />

  * Specify the following JSON object under POST body:
```
{
  "_id": "string",
  "_rev": "string",
  "json": "{\"SeqID\": 0,\"DBName\": \"myward\"}"
}
```

  * Finally click on `Try it out` button to run the `POST /getAllModifications` API. The API response should get shown in the `Response Body` as shown in snapshot below.

  <img src="doc/source/images/SwaggerToolsForTestingMobileFirstAdapter.png" alt="Swagger UI for testing MobileFirst Adapters" width="1024" border="10" />
  
Delete the temporary credentials after testing adapter REST API as below:
  * Inside the MFP dashboard, click on `Runtime Settings`. Click on `Confidential Clients`.
  * Delete the `Client ID` created previously.


## Step 7. Run application on Android phone

Follow the instructions in [Step 7](https://github.com/IBM/Ionic-MFP-App#step-7-run-application-on-android-phone) of base project to run the application on Android phone.

## Step 8. Test the app functionality in offline mode

### How the app works in offline mode
A note on how the offline mode is supported for each of the pages<sup>\*</sup> in MyWard app: (<sup>\*</sup>Ionic page is the equivalent of [iOS View](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/ViewPG_iPhoneOS/CreatingViews/CreatingViews.html) or [Android Activity](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/))

* `Login` page:
  - The first time the app is launched after installation, the user login will work only in online mode. This is to make sure that the user credentials are validated by making a call to MFP security adapter. Once the user authentication succeeds, subsequent login attempts by the same user are supported in offline mode with the help of encrypted [JSONStore](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/7.0/authentication-security/offline-authentication/).

* `Home` page: (downstream sync)
  - [JSONStore](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/application-development/jsonstore/) for storing/syncing data with Cloudant.
  - [imgcache.js](https://github.com/chrisben/imgcache.js/) for caching the image thumbnails loaded from Cloud Object Storage.

* `Problem Detail` page: (downstream sync)

  Grievances for which the deatils are already seen in online mode:
  - JSONStore for storing/syncing data with Cloudant.
  - imgcache.js for caching the image loaded from Cloud Object Storage.
  - [Cordova plugin for Google Maps](https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps#what-is-the-difference-between-this-plugin-and-google-maps-javascript-api-v3) to make sure that the map view works even in offline mode.

* `Report New Problem` page: (upstream sync)
  - Data to be uploaded to Cloudant is stored in JSONStore which later syncs it with Cloudant when device comes online.
  - Image and its thumbnail are stored on local storage, and are later uploaded to Cloud Object Storage when devices comes online.

Note: In the current implementation, images and its thumbnails are stored as-is on the local file storage at [cordova.file.dataDirectory](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-file/#where-to-store-files) which is private to the application. If you have a more stringent compliance requirement of having to encrypt the images stored locally on the phone, then follow the recommendations on [this](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/application-development/jsonstore/#security-utilities) page.

### 8.1 Test app in online mode
* Build and run the application on your phone as per instructions in [Step 7.6](https://github.com/IBM/Ionic-MFP-App/blob/master/README.md#76-buildrun-the-ionic-application-on-android-phone).
* Login with username say `Test` and password `Test`. (Note: We have used a simple MFP security adapter that returns success when password equals username.)
* Make sure that the `Home` page displays list of grievances along with image thumbnails.
* Click on a few of the grievances to see their details. On the `Problem Detail` page, make sure that the image and Google Maps location are displayed.
* Back on the `Home` page, click on the `+` icon to report a new grievance. Add description, take photo, grab gelocation and finally submit. Make sure that the new grievance is successfully submitted to server.
* On a different device, whoever launches the app (or clicks on refresh button) should see your newly reported grievance.

### 8.2 Test app in offline mode
* Have the device go offline by turning off `Mobile data` and `Wi-Fi`.
* Launch the `MyWard` app.
* Login using the same username and password as before. Make sure login succeeds even in offline mode.
* Make sure that the `Home` page displays list of grievances along with image thumbnails.
* Click on the grievances for which you had seen the details before. Make sure that the image and Google Maps location are displayed even in offline mode.
* Back on the `Home` page, click on the `+` icon to report a new grievance. Add description, take photo, grab gelocation and finally submit. Make sure that the new grievance report is successfully accepted even in offline mode.
* Back on the `Home` page, the newly reported problem should get listed at the end along with its thumbnail. Upon clicking it, the `Problem Detail` page should show image.
* Get the device online by turning on either `Mobile data` or `Wi-Fi`.
* In a while the newly reported grievance would get uploaded to server and page would get refreshed to show new list of grievances as seen on server. Make sure that the grievance that you just reported is listed as well.
* On a different device, whoever launches the app (or clicks on refresh button) should see your newly reported grievance.
